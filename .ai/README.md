## For AI Agents

| `INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Procedures and standing orders |
| `<topic>/CONTEXT.md` | Topic-specific background |
| `<topic>/INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Topic-specific procedures |

**Start here:** Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, then `CONTEXT.md`.

**Standing order:** When the user provides substantial context, integrate it into the appropriate file. See `INSTRUCTIONS.md` for details.

## For Humans

You have opened the machine ledger. The human-facing documentation lives one level up in readme.md alongside the scripts you actually want to run. Close this tab, follow the parent README, and everything will make more sense.

This folder is housekeeping for the AI assistants: procedures, decisions, and reminders so they do not ask you the same questions twice. If humans start editing it, the notes drift and the automation gets unreliable. Best to leave it untouched.

If curiosity brought you here, great—consider it a backstage pass. Nothing secret, just operational minutiae. For real guidance, return to the main README and the platform-specific folders.

Treat this as a signpost, not a destination. The configurations you care about are in the rest of the repository. This drawer stays in order because the agents maintain it.
