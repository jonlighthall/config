## For Humans

You've wandered into the machine room—the filing cabinet where the bits leave notes for each other. This is not the README you're looking for. That one is in the parent directory, and it actually explains what this repository does.

This folder contains the administrative scaffolding: the decisions made, the patterns established, the continuity thread that prevents the same conversations from happening twice. It's all very organized. The machines are proud of it.

You're welcome to look. You're just not supposed to. It's not because the content is secret (it's all plain English). It's because this information becomes stale if humans start treating it as guidance. The machines need to maintain it. Humans have the parent directory for that.

**What you're looking for is in the parent directory.** Read `readme.md`. Clone the repo. Link your config files. That's all you need. This folder will be here, quietly organizing itself, when the machines need it.
